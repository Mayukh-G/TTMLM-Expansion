-   Structures are a bit buggy right now and should be disabled in the config if the server hangs or freezes often or sometimes does not load the world
    Currently working on fixing them

- Fixed an issue with Endermen and Ghasts, and Zombified Piglin


MISC:

- Potentially improved structures, they still are buggy.
